# Tic_Tac_Toe

This is a game of Tic-Tac-Toe coded in Java that can be played one of two ways:

1) Against a friend, taking turns.
2) Against a simple AI that uses randomized, but legal, moves.

The game ends when either Player 1 or Player 2 (be they friend or AI) either get three in a row, or when the board is filled up and no more moves can be made
